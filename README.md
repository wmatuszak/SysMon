# SysMon
Simple BASH Tools for Monitoring Networks and Hosts

This is a pet project to attempt to create a rudimentary and light-weight network monitoring solution based on the typical workflow of a human sysadmin.

SysMon is a set of Bash scripts, paired with a SQLite database and some fundemental *nix admin tools:

- Nmap
- SSH
- wmic (Installing WMIC on Linux: https://gist.github.com/jkern/301118)

The idea was to create a rough automation framework based on existing tools easily monitor a mixed network without the need for agents or collector software.
